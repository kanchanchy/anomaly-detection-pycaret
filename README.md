# Anomaly Detection using PyCaret

The purpose of this repository is to build anomaly detection models using PyCaret. Built-in dataset from PyCaret library is used to evaluate the anomaly detection model.

To summarize, this repository performs the following operations:
1. Loading data from Pycaret library
2. Exploring the data by plotting visualizations
3. Preprocessing the data for anomaly detection model
4. Building anomaly detection model
5. Evaluating anomaly detection model
6. Deploying anomaly detection model
